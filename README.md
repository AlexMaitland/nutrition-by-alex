  * By setting out the plans side by side and by listing the services included the user can easily compare between plans. They may then choose a plan that best suits them.

  * The social media links highlight blue when hovered over and open in a new tab when clicked.

## **Testing** 

During the creation of the website, the code was tested consistently after each section was added to the page. The websites responsiveness was tested initially by using the inspect function on Google Chrome. This was a quick way to see how the website interacted on different screen sizes. 

This is where the where I encountered the largest amounts of bugs. With the About Me section for example, the image of the nutritionist would remain next to the text on the right hand side and become increasingly small. This looked dreadful so the code was amended by changing the display properties of both the text and image to 'block' rather than inline-block on smaller screen sizes. The image was set to a width of 70% of the display when shifted below the text. This helped with the overall flow of the website on smaller devices. 

### **Validator Testing**

  * No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input+with_options)
