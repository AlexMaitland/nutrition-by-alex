# **Nutrition By Alex**

Nutrition By Alex is a site which looks to provide information about the background & services provided by the Nutritionist, Alex. The main goal is to build trust with the user that they are in the right place and that Alex is a professional whom they can be assured will help them. By doing so the hope is the users sign up for one of the four "Plans" and submit their personal details. Nutrition By Alex will be ideal for people looking to make a change to their diet and need the assistance of a professional yet approachable nutritionist. The site is aimed at 18 - 39 year old men & women which is evidenced by the somewhat relaxed and informal text approach as well as the color scheme and font choices.

* How I Can Help 
  * The How I Can Help section begins with highlighting the benefits of a healthy diet with an embedded Youtube video that the user can choose to watch should they wish.
  * This section moves on to clearly showcase the four different plans that the user can choose from and what each plans includes. 
  * By setting out the plans side by side and by listing the services included the user can easily compare between plans. They may then choose a plan that best suits them.
  * On smaller screens the plans are stacked on top of each other which still allows the user to compare plans easily.
  * As the elements of each plan are listed you can see clearly the benefits of choosing one of the plans towards the right hand side of the page.

* Get In Touch
  * In the Get In Touch section the user can provide basic contact information and select a plan they would like to find out more about. 
  * The nutritionist can then use this information to make an initial contact with the user, already knowing which plan they are interested in, and can hopefully start helping the user achieve their goals.

## **Testing** 

During the creation of the website, the code was tested consistently after each section was added to the page. The websites responsiveness was tested initially by using the inspect function on Google Chrome. This was a quick way to see how the website interacted on different screen sizes. 

This is where the where I encountered the largest amounts of bugs. With the About Me section for example, the image of the nutritionist would remain next to the text on the right hand side and become increasingly small. This looked dreadful so the code was amended by changing the display properties of both the text and image to 'block' rather than inline-block on smaller screen sizes. The image was set to a width of 70% of the display when shifted below the text. This helped with the overall flow of the website on smaller devices.
