                        <p>Hey there, I'm Alex.</p><br>
                        <p>I'm a total fitness and nutrition nut (I've got a first class honours degree in Sport and Exercise Science and a distinction in Human Nutrition at Master's level to prove it!). As a registered nutritionist, I'm all about making evidence-based content accessible and easy to understand for everyone.</p><br>
                        <p>But I'm not just about the science-y stuff - I'm also obsessed with all things health, wellbeing, and mindset. From trying out new wellness trends to practicing yoga to reading up on the latest self-care tips, I believe that taking care of your body and mind is the key to living your best life.</p><br>
                        <p>So if you're looking for a fun, laid-back, and informative resource to help you on your health journey, you've come to the right place.</p><br>
                        <p>Let me show you what I can do for you!</p>
